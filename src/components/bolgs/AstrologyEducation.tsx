          What is Astrology?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Astrology is an ancient practice that studies the movements and positions of celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, planets, and stars, to understand their influence on human lives and natural events. It is divided into various branches, including natal astrology, mundane astrology, and electional astrology.

          The Zodiac Signs
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          The zodiac is divided into 12 signs, each representing specific personality traits and characteristics. These signs are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Your sun sign, determined by your birth date, is the most commonly known aspect of astrology.
